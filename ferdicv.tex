%\begin{itemize}
%\item Advisor: Nak Young Chong
%\item Thesis: Enforcing Personalized Human-Robot Interaction through an Integrated Epigenetic Robot Architecture
%\item My Ph.D. is about the design of developmental robot architecture inspired from psychological studies, where the robot is able to developmentally learn in a symbolic manner based on visual stimuli regarding its interaction with human (verbally) and the environment (physically).
%\item I developed my own image processing module using the currently available technique (saliency detection, object detection and tracking), using ROS and OpenCV.
%\item I have experience with Kinect using PointCloud and multiple grasping point of an object, as well as a stereo-vision and generic RGB camera.
